* Scenes abstraction (Loading Screen, Drone configurator, Universe Map)Â´
** Scene as configuration
** represented by a graph and metainformation


* Multiple tiers
** Probe only:
We are adrift, waking up, not recalling our purpose nor mission. Some systems are down and we need to get things running again
Start with activating a repair drone... After fixing sensors we can open a map view
** Start System
In a KSP like view, we see a star, probably planets, the kuiper belt and some bigger plantoids/asteroids. We can start doing hohman transfers to gather resources to get the printers running.
